# Sentry Criteria

I am able to retrieve all the information needed. But there is some problems.
Problems:
 I think Most Important Problem is Its compatible to Windows.
1. JDK 8:
       I am able to retrieve java version but after retrieving I am comparing it with only Java version 1.8.0_131. That's static thing what I have done.
      
2.  OS      :
        My Code is only compatible to Windows machine. I am unable to test on other machines.
 
3. RAM  : I am able to retrieve but not able to compare with required ram.

4. Internet: I am able to retrieve but able to compare.

I am working on above things.
